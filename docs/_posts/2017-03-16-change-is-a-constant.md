Introduction
--------

It's with a heavy heart to say that this will be the last TechRadar post that I'll publish as I head off to pastures new at the end of the week. Rest assured however, the TechRadar will continue in my absence.
Over the past year the initiatives that have come on the back of this have resulted in us getting much more familiar with tech stacks that align very closely with our GDS-aligned clients which will undoubtedly help us continue to be very attractive to the public sector. There has been a lot of new information, technologies and approaches for us to get our head around - we must remember that change is a constant within our industry - we must continually inspect and adapt.

Backend & Modern Architectures
------------------------------

[Muhammad gave a good talk on what's new with SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database](https://www.yammer.com/sfwltd.co.uk/#/Threads/show?threadId=852959191) recently. Particularly with the [GDPR](https://www.yammer.com/sfwltd.co.uk/topics/21173567#/Threads/AboutTopic?type=about_topic&feedId=21173567) on the horizon, understanding different mechanisms for storing and encrypting data will be paramount (see also [SHA1 being decrypted](https://www.yammer.com/sfwltd.co.uk/#/Threads/show?threadId=849421251).
This month has seen the release of Visual Studio 2017 and a start of improving tooling support for .NET Core by allowing csproj projects to be built in VSTS. [.NET Core 2.0 is expcted in the next few months](https://www.yammer.com/sfwltd.co.uk/#/Threads/show?threadId=859614775). The [Kotlin](kotlin) language also got it's first major new version release in 1.1, which adds experimental support for Co-Routines (similar to async/await as in C#), as well as a variety of other new language features to make code easier to read. We also [got a glimpse into what PHP 7.2 has in store](https://www.yammer.com/sfwltd.co.uk/#/Threads/show?threadId=842430114), and [some musings about Python](https://www.yammer.com/sfwltd.co.uk/#/Threads/show?threadId=844149642).
Finally, [Thoughtworks' TechRadar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) highlighted an [interesting, lightweight approach for capturing architectural decisions on agile projects](https://www.yammer.com/sfwltd.co.uk/#/Threads/show?threadId=842466004). 

DevOps
------

We've started a trial of Windows 10 Anniversary Update which has been rolled out to 5 staff. [There's been a](https://www.yammer.com/sfwltd.co.uk/#/Threads/show?threadId=855324162) [couple of posts](https://www.yammer.com/sfwltd.co.uk/#/Threads/show?threadId=855368326) detailing the experience of using Bash for Windows Subsystem for Linux. There'll undoubtedly be a few teething issues with this but it should provide better support for running the myriad of DevOps tooling that was built with Linux in mind.
We continue to see a lot of work with the Home Office so understanding how [Docker](docker) and [Kubernetes](kubernetes) work will be crucial to ensure we are credible with them.

Front-end
---------

With the MOD project about to come to a close, watch this space for a Front-End JavaScript Dojo in the next couple of months. We're seeing quite a bit of work for [Angular](angular) at the moment both within Digital and across wider Civica. Also with platforms such as the [SharePoint framework](sharepoint-framework) also supporting these libraries it's a good opportunity to share and learn!
