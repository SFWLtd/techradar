Introduction
============

This month the TechRadar reports have a more accessible home. From now on, no more PDF trees will be chopped down as the reports will now be available from this blog. More work will be needed on the theming, feel free to contribute as the source can be found [here](https://github.com/SFWLtd/techradar).

Progress this month
-------------------

We've begun the long road towards DevOps as an organisation this month, Peter Whateley, Dilip, @daveraine and @mattdsmith89 have started getting together to plan our attack to prepare ourselves for much more rapid feedback. DevOps is not just about technology, rather it is also, more importantly about the people, and adapting processes to enable people to work together faster in a more collaborative way.
