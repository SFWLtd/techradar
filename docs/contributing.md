Contributing
============

To the TechRadar
----------------

The source code behind the TechRadar as well as this documentation can be found on [our GitHub account](https://github.com/SFWLtd/techradar/). If you would like to make a suggestion for what goes on or moves on the TechRadar, or add some information to any of the blips on the radar there are many ways for you to do so:
* Clone the code from GitHub, modify the docs/assets/js/radarData.js file directly and submit a Pull Request to get that merged in
* Raise an issue on GitHub - [for example](https://github.com/SFWLtd/techradar/issues/3)
* Speak to [Adam Londero](sip:adaml@sfwltd.co.uk) directly

To our initiatives
------------------

As mentioned in [Richard Press’ Intranet announcement](https://intranet.sfwltd.co.uk/Lists/Announcements/DispForm.aspx?ID=459), we’re always on the look-out for interested people to help us progress our vision for helping SFW adapt to the industry, and put our best foot forward when winning new work.
If you have time available, and Nick doesn’t have anything for you, speak to Adam. Tell us what you are interested in and we will connect you with someone leading in that area.  There are more technologies, techniques, and approaches in existence and evolving in the marketplace than any one person can keep abreast of, so we need to harness the ability of all of you, to discover, research and learn – and critically to share the information you have found. This could be a Yammer post, a wiki article, maybe also a slot at a show and tell, tech evening, or full dojo.  Documented learnings don’t have to be war and peace, but equally copy and paste from Wikipedia isn’t going to cut it. We are looking for people to show insight, applied to our domain and customer base, which will be of genuine benefit to others.
