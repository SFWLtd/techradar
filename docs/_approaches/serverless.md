Serverless architectures are not about not running your code on servers, but actually in not architecting around optimising the use of servers. Ie. abstracting away the notion of servers, taking advantage of PaaS and SaaS services (particularly things like [AWS Lambda](aws-lambda.html), and [Azure Functions](azure-functions.html)) to more rapidly develop and concentrate more on delivering value to users.
