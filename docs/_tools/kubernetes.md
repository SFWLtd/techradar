Container orchestration. Used [extensively](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice) at the Home Office. In conjunction with [Minikube](minikube.html), this should make it much more easy to manage and scale your application's docker containers.

Moreover, Kubernetes has strong integration with both Azure and AWS, making management of the instances there simple.
