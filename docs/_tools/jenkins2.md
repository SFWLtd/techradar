With the improvement to the build and release pipelines within <a href="vsts.html">VSTS</a>, the relevance of Jenkins has reduced. Further, if we were to need a tool over and above that, there are many other tools available that seem to be better suited, for example <a href="ConcourseCI.html">ConcourseCI</a> or <a href="lambdacd.html">LambdaCD</a>. Existing projects using Jenkins need not transfer across immediately, but new projects should seriously consider alternatives.
