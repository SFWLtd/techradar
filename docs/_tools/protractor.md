We intended to use thison the <a href="http://project-radiator-angular.azurewebsites.net/project/MOD01">MOD eRASP project</a>. However, it didn't seem to be that intuitive. In general we're currently questioning and assessing the logic of tying the test language with the application code. In theory as long as the automated tests don't require a non-representative environment, it may be favourable to use a more familiar framework.
