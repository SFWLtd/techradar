Weâ€™ll be using [Mural](https://mural.co) combined with free iPhone app [3M post-it](3m-post-it.html)
The main purpose is overcome one of our biggest challenges during the research process, which is the analysis process (turning it more Agile by making sure we have affinity sessions, using the help of our internal UX community).
We need to think in creative solutions to help us make the most of our findings and optimise our deliverables to the client.
With a combination of the 2, it will be possible to capture post-it notes (requires iPhone with ios 8) and use Mural to share, discuss and analyse findings with the wider team or relevant stakeholders (remotely and with flexibility).
